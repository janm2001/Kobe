                      <h2>Who was Kobe Bryant</h2>
                      
                      <p>Kobe Bryant spent his early years in Italy and joined the NBA straight out of high school. A dominant scorer, Bryant won five NBA championships and the 2008 MVP Award with the Los Angeles Lakers. Although later seasons were marred by injuries, he surpassed Michael Jordan for third place on the NBA all-time scoring list in December 2014 and retired in 2016 after scoring 60 points in his final game. In 2018, Bryant earned an Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film for Dear Basketball. On January 26, 2020, he was in a helicopter crash that killed Bryant, his 13-year-old daughter Gigi and seven others.</p>
                      <h2>Early Life</h2>  
                      <p>Kobe Bean Bryant was born on August 23, 1978, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Named after a city in Japan, Bryant is the son of former NBA player Joe "Jellybean" Bryant.</p>
                      <p>In 1984, after ending his NBA career, the elder Bryant took the family to Italy, where he played in the Italian League. Growing up in Italy alongside two athletic older sisters, Shaya and Sharia, Bryant was an avid player of both basketball and soccer. When the family returned to Philadelphia in 1991, Bryant joined the Lower Merion High School basketball team, leading it to the state championships four years in a row. With an eye on the NBA, he also started working out with the 76ers.
                      <p>NBA from high school. He was selected by the Charlotte Hornets with the 13th overall pick of the 1996 NBA draft and was subsequently traded to the Los Angeles Lakers.</p>
                      <h2>NBA Career</h2>
                      <p>In his second season with the Lakers, Bryant was voted a starter for the 1998 All-Star Game, becoming the youngest All-Star in NBA history at 19. The shooting guard then teamed up with superstar center Shaquille O'Neal to win three consecutive NBA championships and was voted first-team all-NBA from 2002-2004. He also inked multi-year endorsement deals with Adidas, Sprite and other top sponsors.</p>
                      <p>Although the Lakers struggled after O'Neal left in 2004, Bryant performed brilliantly. He scored 81 points against the Toronto Raptors in January 2006, the second-highest single-game mark in NBA history, and led the league in scoring that year and the next.</p>

                      <h2>Kobe Bryants Death</h2>
                      <p>(CNN)As millions of fans mourn the death of Kobe Bryant and eight other people killed in a helicopter crash Sunday and investigators look into the tragedy, people close to the NBA legend tried Wednesday to go on with their lives while honoring his memory.</p>
                      <p>The Los Angeles Lakers met at their practice facility for the first time since the crash.</p>
                      <p>While Bryant has been retired from professional basketball for four years, Lakers players still idolize the five-time NBA champion and his legacy permeates their home arena.
                    </p>
                    <p>The Lakers were on a plane back from Philadelphia when the news of Bryant's death got out.</p>
                    <p>Lakers Coach Frank Vogel said he informed his players of Bryant's death -- some had heard, some had not -- then went home and hugged his family.</p>
                    <p>"We did some things that we thought would be therapeutically beneficial," Vogel said. He said the team did some shooting drills but it wasn't a "real practice." He said he wanted his guys to break a sweat and to be around each other.</p>
                    <h3>Feds investigate cause of crash</h3>
                    <p>The aircraft carrying the nine victims crashed into a hillside and missed the top of the hill by 20 to 30 feet, the National Transportation Safety Board said.</p>
                    <p>Preliminary information suggests the helicopter descended rapidly before it crashed in Calabasas, California, NTSB member Jennifer Homendy said.</p>
                    <p>"The descent rate for the helicopter was over 2,000 feet a minute," Homendy said. "This is a pretty steep descent at high speed."</p>
